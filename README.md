 > Implement an AppBar at the top with a title "Photo Gallery".


●  Inside the body of the Scaffold, create a SingleChildScrollView to enable scrolling.


●     Within the SingleChildScrollView, create a Column widget.


●     Inside the Column widget, add a Container to display a welcome message such as "Welcome to My Photo Gallery!".


●     Below the welcome message, create a TextField for users to search for specific photos. Use appropriate styling and placeholder text. No search functionality needed just design the TextField.


●     Implement a Wrap widget to display a grid of photos. 


●     The images must be Network Images. You can choose any network image as you like. There must be at least 6 images in the Wrap Widget.


●     Each photo should be represented by an ElevatedButton or OutlineButton with an Image and caption below it. 


●     While clicking on each image there should be a Snackbar Showing message “Clicked on photo!”.


●     Add appropriate spacing and styling to the buttons, images, and captions.


●     Use a ListView to display a list of ListTile widgets below the photo grid.


●     Each ListTile should represent a photo with a title and a subtitle. Add at least three sample photos to the list.


●     Implement a button, such as an IconButton, that when pressed, displays a SnackBar with the message "Photos Uploaded Successfully!".
